    you decide to charge headfirst into the forest. <br>
    a few minutes after entering and taking a pathway, <br>
    you hear what sounded like an animal's cry for help. <br>
    knowing that it <i>could</i> be a trap, you weigh your decisions.

    uncertain of the risks, you decided to ignore the cry and carry on with your romp through the forest. <br>
