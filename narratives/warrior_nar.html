    due to your rowdy behavior back in your hometown village for various reasons, your 
    fellow villagemen decide to throw you out unless you slay a terrible enemy that is 
    only spoken of in legends and myths within your village. <br>
    it's name... sorrowbrood. <br>
    so, you find yourself at the entryway to a forest where it is said to reside.
</p>

<!-- common path taken -->
<p id="common_path">
    after entering the forest, you decided to take the more commonly used pathway to 
    navigate the forest. <br>
    as you make your way through the rather thick forestry, you happen to look down, 
    and spot some trackings leading down a side path.
</p>

<span id="common_path_menu">
    <button id="follow_tracks"> follow tracks </button>
    <button id="ignore_tracks"> ignore tracks </button>
</span>

<p id="ignored_tracks">
    unsure if whether or not that it could be a trap, you decide to continue down the 
    main pathway, and avoid the animal tracks altogether.
</p>
<!-- use #path_return_menu -->

<p id="followed_tracks">
    with the tracks enticing you and your curiosuty piqued, you choose to follow the 
    tracks down their path. <br>
    when you get to the a clearing on the path way, you hear what sounds like an injured 
    animal. you investigate further, and discover an injured skunk.
</p>

<span id="followed_tracks_menu">
    <button id="cont_tracks"> continue &gt;&gt; </button>
</span>

<p id="injured_skunk">
    seeing this poor skunk moves you, for some reason. it <i>is</i> a skunk. but, you 
    are also not a heartless person. you tend to the skunk's injuries, and take a short 
    break while the timid animal recovers. <br>
    it happens to take a liking to you, so you decide to keep it around for a while.
</p>

<span id="inj_skunk_menu">
    <button id="skunk_continue"> continue &gt;&gt; </button>
</span>

<p id="return_to_path">
    after rescuing the skunk, and keeping it as a companion for a rather lonely journey, 
    you take the path on the other side, and eventually return to the main pathway you 
    were on. <br>
    you shortly come to a crossroads after resuming your journey on the path you've chosen.
</p>

<span id="path_return_menu">
    <button id="crossroads_bttn"> to crossroads </button>

<!-- decrepit path taken -->
<p id="decrepit_path">
    after entering the forest, you decided to take the more commonly used pathway to
    navigate the forest. <br>
    while you're travelling down this path, that has most definitely seen better days, 
    you happen to spot an eerie glow down a narrow side path filled with overgrowth.
</p>

<span id="decrepit_path_menu">
    <button id="glow_avoid_bttn"> avoid eerie glow </button>
    <button id="glow_apprch_bttn"> approach eerie glow </button>
</span>

<p id="glow_avoided">
    deciding to avoid the eerie glow, you decide to continue down the path you were 
    already on. 
</p>

<span id="avoid_glow_menu">
    <button id="glow_avoid_cont"> continue &gt;&gt; </button>
</span>

<p id="glow_approached">
    you find the eerie glow rather mesmerizing, and start treading towards it. <br>
    unbeknownst to you, it is an ice elemental, an enemy of which you have no proper 
    way of counting or fighting back against, that is making the eerie glowing. <br>
    as you approach, you realize your grave mistake more and more, until you start 
    feeling shivers run through you. as you near the elemental entity, you see a bright 
    flash, and suddenly feel your legs get heavy. you realize that you are being encased 
    in solid ice, never to be animated again.

<!-- come to crossroads -->
<p id="crossroads">
    eventually, you come to a point on the path where you can see a crossroads. <br>
    seeing the other path that you had not taken leads you to wonder, what was the point
    of both paths, if they lead to the same place? either way, you shrug it off, as that
    is not the critical thing to worry about at the moment. <br><br>
    you approach a sign that points in several direcitons: <br><br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&#11050; one pointing north with "River Northlyn" printed <br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&#11050; one pointing east with "Icehall Ruins" printed <br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&#11050; one pointing south with "Southlea Cottage" printed <br>

<span id="crossroads_menu">
    <button id="north_bttn"> head north </button>
    <button id="east_bttn"> head east </button>
    <button id="south_bttn"> head south </button>
</span>

<p id="north_river">
    you come to a river at the end of the pathway. you recognize this river after spotting 
    some fish that you are familiar with back in your home village. this is the River Northlyn.
    you take some nice deep breaths, and clear your thoughts, and decide to head back, even 
    though you enjoy a spot of fishing from time to time. but, you have bigger fish to fry.
</p>

<span id="north_menu">
    <button id="north_return"> return to crossroads </button>
</span>

<p id="sout_cottage">
    you head southwards to the cottage that resides at the end of the southern path from the 
    crossroads, to an area commonly known as Southlea. you've been told that some nice old 
    couple live at the lone cottage there, and that they assist travellers. <br>
    you fondly remember those little bits of info from the tavern at your home village, but 
    look upon it with some skepticism. you spot the cottage after being on the path for a 
    while. but, your skepticism gets the best of you, casuing you to turn around, and head back.
</p>

<span id="south_menu">
    <button id="south_return"> return to crossroads </button>
</span>

<p id="east_ruins">
    you head down the road that leads eastwards, to the Icehall Ruins. you've heard rumors 
    that the sorrowbrood you were tasked with hunting lives somewhere in or around it back 
    at your home village.
