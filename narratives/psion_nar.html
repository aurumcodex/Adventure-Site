<!-- telepathy path -->
<p id="telepathy_1">
    using you psychic capabilities, you try and contact your friend via telepathy in order 
    to gain your bearings while searching for them within the tower ruins. <br>
    your friend seems to enjoy a familiar voice enter their head for once, and starts guiding 
    you up the tower. <br>
    they tell you to go right down the ground floor hallway.

</span>

<p id="telepathy_2">
    after coming to the end of the hallway on the ground floor, your friend tells you to head up 
    the stairs, which just so happens to be only way up. makes sense, you think to yourself. 
</p>

</span>

<p id="telepathy_3">
    as you make your way up the stairwell, you ask your friend how they know the way up. <br>
    they reply, "because they dragged me up this way." <br>
    you just shake your head in amusement at that remark, and continue up the stairway.
</p>

<span id="telepathy_menu_3">
    <button id="telepathy_bttn_3"> continue &gt;&gt; </button>
</span>

<p id="telepathy_4">
    you reach the top of the stairway, and prompt your friend where to next. they respond with 
    "head straight down the hallway." simple enough, you remark, but, you can't help but feel a 
    trap could possibly lie within, so you prepare for anything. <br>
    you sprint down the hallway of the top floor of the ruins, toward the end of the same hallway.
    in front of you stands a massive set of double oak doors that lead to where your friend resides.

</span>

<p id="telepathy_5">
    you press on the two doors opening them enough that you can fit through and enter the chamber 
    that lies ahead.

<!-- path of no telepathy -->
<p id="no_telepathy_1f">
    you decide to not use your telepathy abilities, due to your concern that your friend's kidnapper 
    might be able to detect your approaching and want to keep an element of surprise where possible.
    <br>
    you enter the ruins and are immediately met with a fork.

    you come to the end of the hallway, and find nothing but a bunch of cobwebs. you are stunned at how 
    dusty everything is, and return down the path, and take the right path, and eventually come to a stairwell.
    you decide to take the stairs, as you seen no other way up.
</p>

<p id="no_tlpthy_1f_right">
    your intuition guiding you, you turn right, and head down that pathway. as you walk down the corridor, 
    you happen to see the only possible way forward, a stairwell. you decide to take it, as you have no other 
    real options for ascending the tower.

    after many opened doors leading to nothing but ruined de&#x0301;cor, cobwebs, and copious amounts of dust, 
    you have exhausted all of the possible doors that aren't the big double oak doors.
</p>

<p id="no_telepathy_2f_hall">
    you go down the hallway to approach the massive double oak doors. <br>
    you open the doors to confront your friend's kidnapper.
